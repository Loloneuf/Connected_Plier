## Connected_Plier


# Introduction
This project's goal was to centralise diverse works made by several teams of the ROMARIN and Luning ZHU in order to create a connected plier that could, in the future, detect, follow and grab specific objects under the sea. 

# Functionalities 
The plier dispose of 3 different mode of action (automatic, semi-auto and manual) in order to control both horizontal movement and opening/closing while detecting a colored object. Indeed, at the end of the project, the plier was able to detect a green ball, position itself in the ball's axis, evaluate the distance and close itself, while controling the pinching power, when the ball is in the grabbing distance.
